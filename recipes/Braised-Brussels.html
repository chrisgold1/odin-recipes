        a cozy dinner party or a special occasion. The sprouts are tender and flavorful, and the sauce is rich and savory. I served it

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices thick-cut bacon, sliced into 1/4-inch strips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound (450 g) brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, thinly sliced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) chicken broth</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15 g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Cook bacon in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat until just crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving bacon grease in the skillet.</li>
     <li>Place Brussels sprouts in the skillet with the cut-sides down. Increase heat to medium-high and saute in the bacon grease until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
     <li>Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
     <li>Pour in chicken stock and cover skillet with a lid; simmer until Brussels sprouts are bright green, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the lid and continue simmering, until liquid is evaporated and sprouts are at desired tenderness, 3 to 5 more minutes.</li>
     <li>Remove skillet from the heat. Add bacon, butter, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper; stir until butter is melted.</li>
    </ol>
